=======================================
Writing a good report:

 - Vulnerability Title	------------- Including vulnerability type, affected domain/parameter/endpoint, impact etc.
 - CWE & CVSS score	------------- For communicating the characteristics and severity of the vulnerability.
 - Vulnerability Description  ------- Better understanding of the vulnerability cause.
 - Proof of Concept (POC)  ---------- Steps to reproduce exploiting the identified vulnerability clearly and
                                      concisely.

- Impact  -------------------------- Elaborate more on what an attacker can achieve by fully exploiting the
                                     vulnerability. Business impact and maximum damage should
                                     be included in the impact statement.
 - Remediation  -------------------- Optional in bug bounty programs, but good to have.

=====================================
A bug's impact and severity play a significant role during the bounty amount
assignment. In the case of such a disagreement, proceed as follows:

Explain your rationale for choosing this severity score
and guide the security/triage team through each metric
value you specified in the CVSS calculator.
Eventually, you will come to an agreement.
Go over the bug bounty program's policy
and scope and ensure that your submission complies with both. Also, make sure that the bounty amount resembles the policy of the bug bounty program.
If none of the above was fruitful, contact mediation or a similar platform service.

=====================================
cvss score breakdown:

Attack Vector:	        Network - The attack can be mounted over the internet.
Attack Complexity:	Low - All the attacker (malicious admin) has to do is
                        specify the XSS payload eventually stored in the database.
Privileges Required:	High - Only someone with admin-level privileges can access 
                        the admin panel.
User Interaction:	None - Other admins will be affected simply by browsing a
                        specific (but regularly visited) page within the admin panel.
Scope:	                Changed - Since the vulnerable component is the webserver
                        and the impacted component is the browser
Confidentiality:	Low - Access to DOM was possible
Integrity:	        Low - Through XSS, we can slightly affect the integrity of an application
Availability:	        None - We cannot deny the service through XSS
