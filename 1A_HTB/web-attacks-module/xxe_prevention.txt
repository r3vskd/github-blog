Such configurations should be another layer of protection if we miss updating some XML libraries and should also prevent XXE exploitation. However, we may still be using vulnerable libraries in such cases and only applying workarounds against exploitation, which is not ideal.

With the various issues and vulnerabilities introduced by XML data, many also recommend using other formats, such as JSON or YAML. This also includes avoiding API standards that rely on XML (e.g., SOAP) and using JSON-based APIs instead (e.g., REST).

Finally, using Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) is another layer of protection against XXE exploitation. However, we should never entirely rely on WAFs and leave the back-end vulnerable, as WAFs can always be bypassed.

Not allow to read some files (like index.php), as the web server would be preventing a DOS attack caused by file/entity self-reference (i.e., XML entity reference loop).
